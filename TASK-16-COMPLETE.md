## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### GitHub Actions Workflow Structure

```yaml
Workflow: Nintendo Switch 2 Stock Monitor
├── Stock Check Job (every 30 minutes)
│   ├── Environment Setup (Node.js 18, Ubuntu)
│   ├── Dependency Installation (npm ci)
│   ├── Stock Check Execution (with retry logic)
│   ├── Data Logging (JSON artifacts)
│   └── Failure Notification (email alerts)
├── Daily Summary Job (midnight UTC)
│   ├── Artifact Download (previous check data)
│   ├── Data Aggregation (24-hour analysis)
│   ├── Summary Generation (statistics and trends)
│   └── Email Delivery (formatted summary)
└── Health Check Job (manual trigger)
    ├── Configuration Validation
    ├── Network Connectivity Tests
    ├── Email Service Verification
    ├── Data Storage Checks
    └── System Resource Monitoring
```

### One-Shot Execution Model

Each GitHub Actions script follows this pattern:
1. **Initialize**: Configuration validation and setup
2. **Execute**: Single operation (stock check, summary, health check)
3. **Persist**: Save data to artifacts for next run
4. **Cleanup**: Maintenance tasks and graceful exit
5. **Exit**: Clean process termination with appropriate exit codes

### Data Persistence Strategy

```
GitHub Actions Artifacts
├── stock-check-logs-{run-number}/ (7-day retention)
│   ├── logs/error.log
│   ├── logs/application.log
│   └── data/stock-checks.json
└── daily-summary-logs-{run-number}/ (30-day retention)
    ├── logs/summary.log
    ├── data/aggregated-checks.json
    └── reports/daily-summary.json
```

## 📊 GitHub Actions Free Tier Analysis

### Current Configuration Impact

**Scheduled Execution**:
- Stock Check: Every 30 minutes = 48 runs/day
- Daily Summary: Once per day = 1 run/day
- Health Check: Manual only = 0 scheduled runs

**Monthly Usage Calculation**:
- Stock Checks: 48 × 30 × 2.5 minutes = **3,600 minutes**
- Daily Summaries: 1 × 30 × 4 minutes = **120 minutes**
- **Total Monthly Usage**: **3,720 minutes**

**Free Tier Limits**:
- Public Repository: 2,000 minutes/month
- Private Repository: 500 minutes/month

### ⚠️ Important Usage Considerations

**Current schedule exceeds free tier limits**. Documentation includes alternative schedules:
- **Hourly checks**: 1,800 minutes/month (within free tier)
- **2-hour intervals**: 900 minutes/month (well within limits)
- **Business hours only**: 483 minutes/month (optimal for free tier)

## 🔐 Security Implementation

### Repository Secrets Management

**Required Secrets** (4 total):
- `PRODUCT_URL`: Costco product page URL
- `FROM_EMAIL`: Verified sender email address
- `TO_EMAIL`: Notification recipient email
- `RESEND_API_KEY`: Resend service API key

**Security Features**:
- Encrypted secret storage in GitHub
- No secrets exposed in workflow logs
- API key format validation
- Separate development/production keys recommended

### Access Control

**Workflow Permissions**:
- Read access to repository contents
- Write access for artifact uploads
- No elevated permissions required

**Network Security**:
- Outbound connections only (Costco, Resend API)
- No inbound network access
- Secure HTTPS communications
